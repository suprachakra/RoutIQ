# RoutIQ
Smarter route optimization powered by deep intelligence

### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive, enterprise‑grade route optimization platform that integrates real‑time data ingestion, advanced optimization algorithms, and robust analytics for operational efficiency. Designed with a microservices architecture and deployed using cloud‑native technologies, our solution transforms fleet management through innovative IoT and AI techniques.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Data Ingestion:** Leverages Kafka for streaming data from GPS, fleet management, and MDM systems.
- **Advanced Optimization Algorithms:** Utilizes Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Reinforcement Learning for dynamic route optimization.
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** Provides interactive BI dashboards and detailed reports for actionable insights.
- **Seamless Integrations:** Interfaces with external systems for GPS tracking, fleet management, and mobile device management.
- **Scalable & Resilient Architecture:** Built using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for reliable and scalable deployment.
