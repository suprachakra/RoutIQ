# Iteration and Feedback Loops

Our continuous improvement process, detailing iterative cycles, agile retrospectives, and feedback mechanisms that ensure rapid refinement and alignment with strategic goals.

## Iterative Cycle Overview
We follow a strict agile cadence:
- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks
- **Key Meetings:** Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, mid-sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives, and PI planning sessions.
- **Feedback Channels:** Internal demos, stakeholder review meetings, customer pilot feedback, and automated monitoring dashboards.

## Iteration Details

| **Iteration (Sprint)** | **Duration** | **Key Activities**                                        | **Feedback Mechanisms**                           | **Improvement Actions**                               | **Outcome Metrics**                              | **Stakeholders Involved**       |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Sprint 1-2             | 2 weeks      | - Develop MVP for data ingestion and basic optimization.<br>- Establish CI/CD pipeline.             | Daily stand-ups, Sprint Review, End-of-Sprint Demo | Immediate bug fixes; refining initial data validation | 80% feature functionality; initial performance benchmarks | Engineering, Data, Product      |
| Sprint 3-4             | 2 weeks      | - Integrate advanced optimization algorithms (RL).<br>- Develop initial BI dashboards.               | Mid-sprint demos, User testing sessions, Retrospectives | UI/UX refinements; performance tuning; additional unit tests | >90% unit test coverage; positive internal feedback         | Product, Design, QA, Engineering |
| Sprint 5-6             | 2 weeks      | - Pilot new refueling policy and unified tracking in selected regions.<br>- Conduct live testing.     | Pilot feedback surveys, Incident reports, Customer interviews | Iterate on refueling schedule; improve process documentation      | 10% reduction in fuel costs; increased fleet utilization       | Operations, Product, Data, Support |
| Sprint 7-8             | 2 weeks      | - Expand pilot to additional regions.<br>- Integrate continuous feedback loops and retraining cycles.  | End-of-iteration reviews, Dashboard metrics, Stakeholder workshops | Adjust model parameters; update training modules; refine dashboards  | Improved KPIs (e.g., uptime, ROI metrics); high stakeholder satisfaction | All cross-functional teams       |
