|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Investment** | Investment in cloud services, IoT devices, and initial development | Initial CapEx and monthly OpEx     | Scalable cloud pricing; average IoT cost per vehicle assumed | Phased deployment to control costs; vendor negotiations to minimize lock-in | Breakeven within 18–24 months     |
| **Operational Cost Savings**   | Savings from fuel cost reduction, improved route efficiency, and process optimization | Percentage reduction in operational costs | 10–15% cost reduction based on pilot data                     | Continuous process improvement and fallback policies; periodic performance reviews | 20% annual cost reduction         |
| **Revenue Enhancement**         | Revenue uplift from enhanced service offerings and operational excellence | Percentage revenue growth          | Additional revenue of 2–5% from increased efficiency             | Diversified revenue streams and strong market positioning; ongoing adjustments | 15% annual revenue growth         |
| **Training & Development**      | Investment in leadership and technical training programs           | Training cost per session; productivity gains | In-house training leveraged; estimated 5% improvement in operational efficiency | Iterative training programs with regular feedback loops                    | Indirect ROI through increased efficiency |

## Financial Forecasts and Assumptions
