"""
Defines REST API endpoints for the platform.

This module uses FastAPI to expose endpoints for various functionalities, such as
health checks, data retrieval, and integration with analytics modules. It provides
a clear and extendable structure for building RESTful APIs for the fleet optimization platform.

Assumptions:
- FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed and configured.
- In production, endpoints will integrate with databases and downstream services.
