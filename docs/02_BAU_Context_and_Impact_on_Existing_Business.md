# BAU Context and Impact on Existing Business

## Current Business Operations Overview
- **Existing Systems:**  
  Current fleet management relies on legacy systems with manual route planning and fragmented data from separate GPS, fleet management, and maintenance platforms.
- **Key Challenges:**  
  - **Inefficient Routing:** Static, non-adaptive routing models leading to increased fuel consumption and longer travel times.
  - **Data Silos:** Disparate systems result in inconsistent, low-quality data, hampering proactive decision-making.
  - **Limited Predictive Capabilities:** Reactive maintenance and resource allocation due to a lack of advanced analytics.
