"""
Integrates with fleet management systems.

This module simulates interaction with an external fleet management system.
It provides functions to retrieve fleet status, vehicle assignments, and other relevant data.
In production, this module would interface with the actual fleet management API.

Assumptions:
- The external system exposes RESTful endpoints.
- API authentication and error handling are implemented as required.
