# Disaster Scenarios and Macro-Environmental Changes

This document details our disaster recovery plans and strategic responses to macro-environmental shifts, ensuring continuity and resilience.

| **Scenario**         | **Description**                                          | **Impact**                          | **Mitigation Strategy**                                             | **Dependencies**                 | **Response Time**  | **Recovery Objectives**                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Disaster** | Severe weather, earthquakes, floods affecting operations | Downtime, data loss                 | Geo-redundant infrastructure; automated failover; regular DR drills | Cloud provider; backup systems   | <30 minutes       | Restore operations within 1 hour; 99.9% data recovery  |
| **Cyber-Attack**     | Ransomware, DDoS, data breaches impacting system integrity | Service disruption; data compromise | Continuous security monitoring; SAST/DAST scans; incident response plan | Security tools; vendor support   | <15 minutes       | Secure restoration within 1 hour; minimal data loss    |
| **Economic Downturn**| Macro-economic shifts reducing budgets and demand         | Reduced revenue; scaling challenges | Flexible cost structures; scenario planning; diversification strategies | Financial models; market data    | Ongoing monitoring| Adjust budgets and strategies to sustain operations    |

## Strategic Planning
- **Regular DR Drills:** Scheduled tests to ensure readiness.
- **Risk Assessments:** Quarterly reviews of emerging risks.
- **Adaptive Strategies:** Maintain flexibility in operational plans to respond to economic or environmental shifts.
