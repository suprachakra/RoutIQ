# QA and Test Automation

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Implement tests for individual modules using frameworks like pytest.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Validate inter-service communications using Postman collections and automated integration suites.
- **Performance and Stress Testing:**  
  - Simulate high-load scenarios with tools like Locust and Apache JMeter.
- **Security Testing:**  
  - Conduct SAST/DAST scans with SonarQube and OWASP ZAP.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**  
  - Execute user journey simulations to validate full-stack performance from data ingestion to dashboard rendering.

## Automated Test Suite
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Integrate testing into GitHub Actions to run tests on every commit and pull request.
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - Maintain an extensive regression test suite to ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Coverage Goals:**  
  - Aim for >90% unit test coverage and complete critical path integration test coverage.

## QA Best Practices
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**  
  - Encourage writing tests prior to development to clarify requirements.
- **Continuous Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor test performance in real time and adjust test cases based on feedback.
- **Cross-Functional Feedback:**  
  - Regularly review test results with development, operations, and product teams for continuous improvement.
