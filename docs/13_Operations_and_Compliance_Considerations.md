# Operations and Compliance Considerations

## Operational Readiness
- **Unified Tracking and Monitoring:**  
  - Deploy a centralized monitoring system using Prometheus and Grafana to oversee system performance, data quality, and uptime.
- **Process Automation:**  
  - Automate key operational workflows such as data ingestion, route optimization, and alerting to reduce manual intervention.
- **Business Continuity:**  
  - Establish robust backup procedures, disaster recovery plans, and automated failover mechanisms.

## Compliance and Governance
- **Regulatory Requirements:**  
  - Ensure strict adherence to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and industry standards (ISO 27001, SOC 2).
- **Audit Trails and Reporting:**  
  - Implement comprehensive logging and audit trails to facilitate regular compliance audits.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
  - Conduct periodic reviews with key stakeholders to assess compliance status and address any operational gaps.

## Operational Metrics
- **System Uptime:**  
  - Target a 99.99% uptime with continuous monitoring and rapid incident response.
- **Incident Management:**  
  - Define clear SLAs for incident resolution and maintain a dedicated operations team.
- **Performance KPIs:**  
  - Monitor metrics such as latency, data throughput, and error rates in real time.
