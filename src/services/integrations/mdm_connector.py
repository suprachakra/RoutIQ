"""
Connects to Mobile Device Management (MDM) systems.

This module simulates integration with an MDM system to retrieve device status,
sync times, and configuration data. In a production setting, this would involve
secure API calls to an MDM provider.

Assumptions:
- The MDM system offers RESTful endpoints with proper authentication.
- Data is returned in JSON format.
